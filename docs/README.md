# Lulav.io - Drone Interception Visualization Landing Page

A modern, interactive landing page for lulav.io featuring a real-time drone interception visualization. This project showcases advanced defense technology with swarm-based drone interception systems.

## üåü Features

### Interactive Drone Interception Visualization
- **Real-time Swarm Deployment**: Watch as intelligent swarms are deployed to intercept threats
- **3 Drone Threats**: Visual representation of stationary drone threats with health bars
- **Dynamic Interceptions**: Real-time interception battles with explosion effects
- **Live Statistics**: Track swarms deployed, successful interceptions, and success rates
- **Auto-start**: Visualization automatically begins when the page loads

### Modern Design
- **Responsive Layout**: Fully responsive design that works on all devices
- **Smooth Animations**: CSS animations and transitions for enhanced user experience
- **Modern Typography**: Clean, professional typography using Inter font
- **Gradient Backgrounds**: Beautiful gradient backgrounds and visual effects

### User Experience
- **Smooth Scrolling**: Seamless navigation between sections
- **Mobile Menu**: Hamburger menu for mobile devices
- **Contact Form**: Interactive contact form with validation
- **Loading Animations**: Smooth loading and scroll-triggered animations

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- A modern web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)
- No additional dependencies required - pure HTML, CSS, and JavaScript

### Installation
1. Clone or download the project files
2. Open `index.html` in your web browser
3. The landing page will load with the drone interception visualization automatically starting

### File Structure
```
landing_page/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ index.html          # Main HTML file
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ styles.css          # CSS styles and animations
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ script.js           # JavaScript for visualization and interactions
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ README.md           # This file
```

## üéÆ Using the Visualization

### Controls
- **Start Battle**: Begin the drone interception simulation (auto-starts on page load)
- **Pause**: Pause the current animation
- **Reset**: Clear all swarms and reset statistics (auto-restarts)
- **Spawn Rate Slider**: Adjust the rate of swarm deployment (1-10)

### Understanding the Visualization
1. **Swarms**: Colored particle groups that represent interception drones flying from left to right
2. **Drone Threats**: 3 stationary red drones on the right side with health bars
3. **Interceptions**: When swarms collide with drones, they create explosion effects and damage the drones
4. **Statistics**: Real-time counters showing:
   - Total swarms deployed
   - Number of successful interceptions
   - Success rate percentage

### Drone Health System
- Each drone starts with 100% health
- Each successful interception reduces drone health by 20%
- Drones are destroyed when health reaches 0%
- Destroyed drones show an X mark and become inactive

## üé® Customization

### Colors
The color scheme can be modified in `styles.css`:
- Primary blue: `#2563eb`
- Accent yellow: `#fbbf24`
- Threat red: `#ef4444`
- Background gradients: Defined in `.hero` class

### Visualization Settings
In `script.js`, you can adjust:
- Swarm generation rate: Modify the probability in `generateSwarm()`
- Drone damage: Change the damage value in `checkInterceptions()`
- Animation speed: Adjust the speed multiplier in various functions
- Number of drones: Modify the `dronePositions` array in `initializeDrones()`

### Content
Update the content in `index.html`:
- Company information in the About section
- Contact details in the footer
- Social media links

## üì± Responsive Design

The landing page is fully responsive and includes:
- Mobile-first design approach
- Breakpoints for tablets and mobile devices
- Touch-friendly interface elements
- Optimized typography scaling

## üîß Technical Details

### Technologies Used
- **HTML5**: Semantic markup and structure
- **CSS3**: Modern styling with Flexbox and Grid
